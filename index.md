## Occupation

`2014 - 2018`
**Security Engineer [Criptext](https://criptext.com)**<br>
I started working as an Android app developer using Kotlin & Java, designing the
MVC app architecture.<br>
in 2018 I mostly maintained the HTTP API that powers all of Criptext clients using 
Node.js, Go and MariaDB. I designed all the endpoints that clients use to communicate 
securely using the [Signal Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol). 
I implemented the Signal Protocol in Criptext's Android client using Open 
Whisper System's [Java library](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-java).<br>
I was also responsible for reviewing the code submitted by Android, Electron, 
and backend developers, making sure that it remained maintainable and well tested.

`2018 - 2020`
**Lead Android Developer [Technisys](https://www.technisys.com/)**<br>
I developed banking apps for Android phones using [my own implementation](https://github.com/GAumala/mvi-android) of the MVI architecture in Java. Most of my time was spent writing code for the new mobile app of one of the biggest banks in Argentina, but I also had to train the newer collaborators in the Android team by reviewing their pull requests, [writing articles](https://gaumala.com/posts/2019-04-30-writing-mvi-apps-in-android.html) and [giving talks](https://www.meetup.com/Guayaquil-Developers/events/262094535/).<br>

`2020 - 2021`
**Android Developer [ITijuana](https://itjuana.com/)**<br>
I developed Android apps and libraries to test more easily the next generation [OmniPod](https://www.omnipod.com/), an insulin management system that runs on an Android device.

`2021 - now`
**Android Developer [Albert](https://albert.com/)**<br>
I work on the Albert Android app, which offers many features related to banking, savings, and investing.
